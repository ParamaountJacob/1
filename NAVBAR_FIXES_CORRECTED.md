## 🎯 **WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE NOW:**

### **Desktop Navigation:**
```
Home | About | FAQ | Investor Info | Contact | [Profile Icon]
                                                    ↓ (on hover)
                                                  ┌─────────────┐
                                                  │ Pitch Deck  │
                                                  │ ─────────── │
                                                  │ Sign Out    │
                                                  └─────────────┘
```

### **Profile Icon Behavior:**
- ✅ **Hover** → Dropdown appears instantly
- ✅ **Move away** → Dropdown disappears  
- ✅ **Click "Pitch Deck"** → Navigate to /pitch-deck
- ✅ **Click "Sign Out"** → Logout and redirect home

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:**

### **If Pitch Deck Still Doesn't Work:**
1. **Check Console Errors**: Press F12 → Console tab
2. **Verify Route**: Make sure URL shows `/pitch-deck`
3. **Clear Cache**: Ctrl+F5 to hard refresh
4. **Check Authentication**: Make sure you're logged in

### **If Sign Out Still Broken:**
1. **Check Network Tab**: F12 → Network to see requests
2. **Verify Supabase Connection**: Check .env variables
3. **Browser Storage**: Clear localStorage/sessionStorage

## 🎉 **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:**

- ✅ **Hover profile icon** → Dropdown appears
- ✅ **Click "Pitch Deck"** → Goes to pitch deck page
- ✅ **Click "Sign Out"** → Logs out and redirects to home
- ✅ **No unwanted nav items** → Clean, minimal navigation

## 🔍 **WHAT I REMOVED:**
- Main nav "PITCH DECK" link (wasn't requested)
- Dropdown "Profile" option (as requested)
- Mobile menu clutter (simplified)

The navbar should now work exactly as you specified - hover for dropdown, only Pitch Deck and Sign Out options, and working logout functionality! 🚀
