# Investment Display Fix - README

## Problem Summary

We've identified and addressed the following issues causing investments not to appear in dashboards:

### 1. Missing Database Functions
- The key functions `get_user_investments_with_applications` and `get_admin_investments_with_users` were missing
- Application status update function had incorrect naming: `update_application_onboarding_status` vs `update_onboarding_step`
- Parameter name `status` conflicted with column name causing ambiguity errors

### 2. Missing Investment Records
- No automatic creation of investment records from applications
- NULL values violated database constraints

## Changes Made

We've implemented the following fixes:

### 1. Database Function Fix (Emergency)
- Created a migration (20250626172000_emergency_function_fix.sql) that implements the missing functions
- Renamed ambiguous parameter from `status` to `p_status` to avoid conflicts
- Added function permission grants for both authenticated users and service role

### 2. Database Trigger Fix
- Created a migration (20250626171500_fix_investment_triggers.sql) that recreates the `create_investment_on_application_submit` trigger
- This trigger creates an investment record linked to the application immediately after submission
- Added script to create missing investment records for existing applications

### 3. Client-Side Fallbacks
- Added direct query fallbacks if RPC function calls fail
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Makes the system resilient even if functions are missing

### 4. Database Query Improvements
- Created a migration (20250626171600_improve_investment_queries.sql) that enhances both user and admin investment query functions
- These functions now return both investments and standalone applications
- Ensures a complete view of all investment activities in both dashboards

## Verification Steps

1. **Emergency Fix First** (if needed):
   - If you're seeing function not found errors, run the emergency fix PowerShell script:
     ```powershell
     .\check_fix_functions.ps1 -ApiKey "your_service_key" -ApiUrl "https://your-project-ref.supabase.co"
     ```
   - Or apply the emergency migration manually:
     ```
     20250626172000_emergency_function_fix.sql
     ```
   - See `EMERGENCY_FUNCTION_FIX.md` for additional manual fix options

2. **Create a new investment application**:
   - Fill out an investment application form
   - After submission, check the browser console (F12) for logs showing the investment was retrieved

3. **Check Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to your dashboard
   - You should see the new investment listed
   - Check console logs for any errors or successful data retrieval

4. **Check Admin Interface**:
   - Log in as an admin
   - View the investments list
   - You should see all user investments including the new one

## Troubleshooting

If investments still don't appear after these fixes:

1. **Database Errors**:
   - Check browser console for any "function does not exist" errors
   - If present, apply the emergency fix first
   
2. **Database Permissions**:
   - Ensure the authenticated role has proper permissions on the investments table and functions
   - Check logs for any permission denied errors
   
3. **Data Flow and Rendering**:
   - Console logs will show if data is being retrieved but not displayed
   - Examine component rendering logic for filters that might exclude certain investments

## Complete Fix Process

For a complete and proper fix, apply all migrations in the order specified in `MIGRATION_ORDER.md`:

1. First apply the emergency fix if needed
2. Apply remaining migrations in order
3. Verify all dashboards display investments correctly

Contact the development team if issues persist after applying all fixes.
