This file was moved from supabase/migrations/ because it contains Unicode characters in RAISE statements that cause PostgreSQL compilation errors.

The Unicode âœ… characters in RAISE NOTICE statements are not properly escaped and cause:
ERROR: 42601: too few parameters specified for RAISE

Use the fixed version: 20250702110000_comprehensive_restoration_fixed.sql instead.

Or better yet, use the IMMEDIATE_FIX_SOLUTION.sql file to run the essential sync function directly in Supabase SQL Editor.
